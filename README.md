Project for the elective course Data Mining and Machine Learning at CEID, University of Patras.

Assignment 1 is about a time series forecasting. The dataset consists of timestamps describing the 
energy resources of the state of California. At first we do some preprossesing on the data and then we
cluster them into groups by using the K-means Algorithm. Then we predict for each moment of the day how much
energy is needed to be produced from non-renewable sources. We do this by using an LSTM regressor from the
tensorflow framework.

The second assignment is a simple NLP analysis where we guess the rating of amazon products, based on users 
reviews.
